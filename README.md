We are working hard to make this a great tool, but there's still a pretty good
chance you'll encounter missing pieces, rough edges, performance issues and even,
god forbid, bugs 🐞.

Please don't hesitate to ping us at https://t.winglang.io/slack or file an issue at
https://github.com/winglang/wing. We promise to do our best to respond quickly and help out.
